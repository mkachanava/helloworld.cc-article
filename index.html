                <p><strong>A</strong>t Bursted Wood Primary School, children in key stage 1 had already embarked on a
                    secure mathematical journey, putting algebra at the heart of the curriculum. The demands of the 2014
                    National Curriculum meant that in Year 1 children were expected to be taught to use all four
                    arithmetic operations, and fractions, as operators. As a result, Bursted Wood adopted a series of
                    textbooks written by Caleb Gattegno called <span class="highlighted-words">Numbers in Colours</span>. These textbooks use
                    Cuisenaire rods
                    to encourage the learner to explore patterns, and then to give letter code names to the patterns,
                    and record the relationships between them with equations. It is only after the letter code
                    exploration that they finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. white representing one), and
                    transform their equations into arithmetic. Very early on in Year 1, children are able to read and
                    write a variety of complex algebraic</p>

                    arithmetic. The results had been impressive throughout key stage 1. In Year 2 we wanted to take it a
                    step further by running computing lessons using the same use of natural language and level of
                    sophistication.</p>
                <h2>Why Haskell?</h2>
                <p>Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual mathematics and number theory, the inspiration for Gattegno
                    Mathematics. It has four attributes that make it particularly appropriate for mathematics education:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Its syntax is very close to traditional mathematical notation (but beware that it can be too
                        terse).</span></li>
                    <li><span>Variables are statically typed, which means that programmers are protected by the compiler from
                        passing invalid information as an argument (input) or output value.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions ‘lazily’, only when required. This makes it possible
                        to program infinite data structures in finite memory.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Information is passed from the arguments to functions by pattern matching. This is an intuitive
                        way for programmers to envisage and reason about the behaviour of their programs.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="article-content">
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/page1_1.jpg" width="290" height="270" alt="math">
                    <figcaption>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="figcaption">Equivalent expressions using Gattegno’s rod codes to represent the relationship between
                                a rod and equivalent trains of one colour</span></li>

                </figure>
                <h2>Starting with a staircase</h2>
                <p>To start, we went back to a familiar pattern that Gattegno introduces in the textbooks, called a
                    staircase. This is built from one rod of each colour arranged in size order (figure 1). The children
                    were able to physically build the staircase. However, because they were so familiar with the
                    pattern, they could also access it virtually, which would help with debugging and logical reasoning
                    later. A role-play game to establish computational thinking was introduced before any actual
                    programming began. This allowed the children to familiarise themselves with the function calls
                    <span class="highlighted-words">successor</span> and <span class="highlighted-words">predecessor (succ, pred)</span> while traversing the
                    staircase. The children would take turns to ask each other questions such as <span class="highlighted-words">succ
                        White</span> (answer Red) or <span class="highlighted-words">pred Orange</span> (answer Blue). To help the children
                    access the new programming vocabulary, one child

                        <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> $ <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> (successor of successor) which uses function composition
                        $. Some children could creatively enjoy inventing functions such as <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> $
                        <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> $ <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> <span class="highlighted-words">White</span> to test the technique. The children
                        experimented by writing down their calls before building themselves a rod calculator in Haskell.
                        The language soon became a natural part of lessons and meant that it was easy to progress to the
                        next step.

                        in the engine because they had already worked out the answer. The staircase was a familiar
                        pattern, so they could predict what the output should be. Children were also able to edit the
                        <span class="highlighted-words">Colour</span> data type to model odd or even staircases and test their functions to see
                        what the effect would be on the derived <span class="highlighted-words">successor</span> function. A transcript (see

                        <p>Very soon the children were able to construct their own rod calculator in Haskell, by first
                            constructing the engine using the <span class="highlighted-words">Colour</span> data type. Then the children asked the
                            same role-play questions, this time by typing the language into the interpreter window. It
                            soon
                            became apparent that errors in the engine meant that the interpreter would not</p>

                        with a step size White is distinct from the version of <span class="highlighted-words">succ</span> in an even staircase,
                        and he corrects himself. It is clear to see that he has constructed an image of the staircase
                        and is virtually traversing it.</p>

                <h2>Calculating</h2>
                <p>To build the rod arithmetic calculator, the pupil reuses the equations that they studied in Year
                    1. Gattegno’s definitions lie in the algebraic domain. Programming illustrates the distinction
                    between algebra and arithmetic. Making this clear is crucial to investigating the level of
                    abstraction that the learner has reached. The figure shows a rod arithmetic calculator
                    constructed after four terms of Gattegno Mathematics. The values associated with the rod code
                    letters are modelled as constant functions in Haskell. Nine equations are derived from
                    Gattegno’s equivalent expressions. The tenth, which binds an integer value to the code for
                    White, shows the choice of measuring unit, which fixes the values of the other codes.</p>
                <p class="mark">By introducing Haskell to the children we have been able to take the mathematics that the
                    children are familiar with and successfully and creatively introduce programming functions. We
                    have been able to provide both the teacher and child with a rich situation, allowing them to
                    think both mathematically and computationally. It is exciting to think where our investigations
                    may lead us to next!</p>
